# Week-8-Pentesting-Live-Targets

# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: **SQL Injection**

```
3. SQL Injection: Most of the data input received by these websites is being sanitized properly. 
However, one of the three sites has one place where the input is not being sanitized before being 
used in an SQL query. Determine which color has the vulnerability.

* SQL injection at the public/staff/salespeople/show.php?id=?? endpoint. I replaced the ?? with the following code: ' OR SLEEP(4)=0--' (which becomes %27%20OR%20SLEEP(4)%20=%200--%27 when encoded in a URL). This snippet forced the SQL query (and thus our entire request) to pause for 4 seconds, which indicates a successful injection.





Vulnerability #2: **Session Hijacking/Fixation**

```
6. Session Hijacking/Fixation: Two of the three websites expire their active sessions and 
require users to re-login every 30 minutes. That is probably too aggressive for the real world, 
but it is better than the third site which allows sessions to be a year old, and never regenerates 
the session ID, even when the user agent string changes. This makes it vulnerable to both session 
hijacking and session fixation attacks.

* Use two different web browsers or tabs. Let one tab be the attacker and the other the target. You can attempt a session hijacking or session fixation, all up to you. For hijacking, log the target in first, then give the logged-in session ID to the attacker. For fixation, get a session ID for the attacker, give it to the target, then the target will log in. In either case, the attacker now has access.
